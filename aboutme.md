I'm a data engineer and solution architect, with a secret love for site reliability engineering. I
work for a company that has some ships. I try my best to stay on top of recent developments in
applied ML and AI (just the pipes, I leave the nerdy maths stuff for some brilliant data
scientists).

You can check me out on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinmorset/) if you want. I
sometimes put up some half-finished hobby projects on [github](https://github.com/dingobar) too.
