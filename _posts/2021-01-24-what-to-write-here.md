From time to time the idea of writing my thoughts down in a blog comes to me. However, it often ends
up with me flopping around like a fish on land trying to wrestle with some `express.js` and `Vue.js`
serverless setup, and it never really ends up with something I can use although it is nice to dip
ones toes in the `JavaScript` world from time to time.

This time is different - I've created this out-of-the-box GitHub pages site that uses `jekyll` to
serve some `MarkDown` documents.

I hope that the next time I learn something that I thought was cool, I can write a post about it
here. It will probably be something about coding, infrastructure or devops, but maybe some day I
will also be inspired to write something about gaming or even food, who knows.
